## DJmocracy

DJmocracy is a crowd sourced playlist generator integrated with spotify for house parties/events where the hosts would like the guests to have a say in what they're listening to.

Guests can log into the event, suggest songs, and vote on the songs in the event's current playlist.
The event's playlist will sort itself based on popularity.
